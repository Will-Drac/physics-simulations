pick a consistent style for all simulations
    make all simulations use the css file

absorption in the light wave simulation finally

New ideas:
    mechanics roller coaster OR mechanics sandbox <- cooler i think

    atom/molecule quantum physics simulation

    nuclear physics stuff (not exactly sure what)

    3d magnetic field of solenoid, loop, and wire
        visualizing the field with arrows and having particles go through, all real time

    induction things

    beats but you can see the graph and hear them

    thin films, somehow

    circuit simulation with capacitors where it shows you voltage and current and charge and all that

    relativistic render engine
