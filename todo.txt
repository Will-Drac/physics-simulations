pick a consistent style for all simulations

absorption in the light wave simulation finally

New ideas:
    wave on a spring, with connected springs of different spring constant
        WHY DOES IT WORK DIFFERENTLY ON MY SECOND MONITOR

    mechanics roller coaster OR mechanics sandbox

    nuclear physics stuff (not exactly sure what)

    3d magnetic field of solenoid, loop, and wire
        visualizing the field with arrows and having particles go through, all real time

    induction things

    small angle approximation vs real in pendulums

    sound interference: place sources and see how they interfere in 2d space
        some things left to do

    doppler effect, seeing the waves spread (looking compressed in front and elongated behind), and actually hearing the sounds

    beats but you can see the graph and hear them

    thin films, somehow

    capacitors, somehow
